# AndroidResourceManager
Just a simple project, which shows how you can use a resource manager in android. 

Usually for my projects, instead of using getString(R.string.STRING_ID), I use a resource manager to access android resources.
This is done, to make sure that I can seperate Java and Android code.

In this example, I have made a singleton class, which acts as a resource manager.
There are many ways which a resources manager can be implemented. This is just one.
